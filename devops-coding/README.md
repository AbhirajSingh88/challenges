# Tagup DevOps Coding challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining our team! This challenge is a simple test for us to evaluate your technical abilities.

## Challenge Description

The challenge is to develop a simple AWS S3 storage analysis tool.

## Specifications

The tool is a shell command line utility that returns information over all [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) buckets in an Amazon account.
- Your tool must work on Linux and OSX.
- It must be easy to install and use.
- Ideally, your tool won't require installation of any other tools / libraries / frameworks to work.
- Your solution should return results within seconds.


### The tool must return the following information

For each bucket:
- Name
- Creation date
- Number of files
- Total size of files (an option should permit to display it in bytes, kB, MB, ...)
- Last modified date of the most recent file

## Deliverable

Your are free to use the programming language and the [SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) of your choice.
Important, the installation must not require us to install external tools in order to test the result of your work.

Your project should be hosted on github and be a standalone project (i.e. **do not fork it from our challenge or any other project**).


## Tips

Try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code. Show us how you create clean and maintainable code that produces awesome result.
Build something that we'd be happy to contribute to.

Feel free to add more features: we're curious about what you can think of. We'd expect the same if you worked with us!

Documentation and tests are always a hude plus.
