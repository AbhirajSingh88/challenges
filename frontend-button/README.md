# Tagup front-end challenge - button

Thanks for your interest in joining our team! This challenge is a simple test for us to evaluate your technical abilities.

Your objective is to create a re-usable button component.

## Key requirements
- The look & feel of the button can be something like [this](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-argon-dashboard-pro/#/components/buttons).
- The button should have different colors, that you can pass via `props`.
- The button should have both filled and outlined styles (only border colored). `outline` should also be configurable via a prop.
- The button can have different sizes (small, default, large). These should be also configurable via `props`.
- The button can contain text inside, icons or both text and icons.
- Button should have a `loading` state. You should also configure this via `props`.
- All props should contain proper validations.

## You can use
- Any icon set like font-awesome for icons
- Codesandbox or similar for hosting
- React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.js

## You cannot use
- Any css framework. Weâ€™d like to see the styling for the button done from scratch without any css library like bootstrap or material ui.
