# Tagup front-end challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining our team! This challenge is a simple test for us to evaluate your technical abilities.

Your objective is to create a mini timeline app. Detailed requirements are below. You may use the picture below as a design reference (though are in no way bound by its design):

![design reference](./design-reference.png)

## Key requirements
- Build reusable components for cards and buttons;
- When clicking `Submit Log` button in the form, a new log will be added to the list of cards below;
- Each timeline item contains a title, a message and a formatted date like in the picture;
- Show a confirmation modal when pressing delete button with "Confirm/Cancel" buttons, and delete the selected log when pressing "Confirm".
- Implement a search bar that filters logs by title.

## Hints
- You can use static data or generate it yourself. No need to request it from an API;
- You may use a 3rd party library (for example, moment.js).
- Please treat the design reference as a wireframe. We encourage you to use your own design sense to improve the style.

## Bonus Points
- Feel free to add more features: we're curious what you can come up with!
- Tests and clean documentation is always appreciated.

## What we will take into consideration
- The code contains the mentioned components: Cards, Button, and optionally a modal
- Reusability of the components
- Code cleanliness and readability
- Overall functionality

## What we will NOT take into consideration
- The framework you choose to build this app. You can even use vanilla web components if you'd like, so long as your code is clean and easy to understand.

## Deliverable

We will be reviewing both your source code and the working application. Source code should be provided either via Github or a zip file. We need to easily view your working application, so we encourage you to deploy on a public cloud if possible (Heroku, AWS, etc.; all have free tiers you can use). If that isn't something you have experience with then you can provide the output of a build with reasonable instructions for viewing it.


If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to email [challenges@tagup.io](mailto:challenges@tagup.io) and we'll get back to you ASAP.
