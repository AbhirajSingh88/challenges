# Tagup DevOps challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining our team! This challenge is a simple test for us to evaluate your technical abilities.

Your objective is to create a proposal for the ops/devops portions of a hypothetical stack.

## Hypothetical stack
- Vue.js web application
- Node.js express middleware exposing APIs
- Mongodb supporting middleware
- Backend python application to process data and write to mongodb


## Key requirements
We will be considering things such as:
- ease of deployment
- resiliency (and what are the downtime risks)
- monitoring
- security (access and protection around DDOS)
- scale
- development process
- cost

After you submit your proposal we will have a conversation about it.


If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to email [challenges@tagup.io](mailto:challenges@tagup.io) and we'll get back to you ASAP.
